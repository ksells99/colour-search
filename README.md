# JavaScript Colour Name/HexCode/RGB search app
Inspired by Traversy Media's JS autocomplete tutorial, this application allows the user to search for colour names, RGB values and hex codes, fetched from a local JSON file.

The app can be accessed here: **https://ksells99.github.io/colour-search/**


**Update**: now added ability to search by RGB value - requires it to be entered without brackets and with no spaces between values (e.g "*r,g,b*").
